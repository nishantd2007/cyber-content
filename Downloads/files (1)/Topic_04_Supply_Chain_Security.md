📦 You locked your front door. But did you check who your vendors gave keys to?

SolarWinds wasn't a fluke. Supply chain attacks up 742% in 2025.

Your security is only as strong as your weakest vendor's intern's password.

📦 **Supply Chain Security: The Attack Vector You Can't Fully Control**

Your security team is top-notch. Your infrastructure is locked down. Your employees are trained.

But what about your vendors? And their vendors? And those vendors' vendors? 🤔

**The uncomfortable reality:**
→ Average company has 850+ third-party vendors
→ 63% of breaches involve third-party access
→ 742% increase in supply chain attacks since 2024
→ SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) compliance now mandatory for federal contracts

**Recent wake-up calls:**

🔴 **SolarWinds (2020):** 18,000+ customers compromised via trojanized update
🔴 **Kaseya (2021):** 1,500+ companies hit via MSP software update
🔴 **3CX (2023):** VoIP software supply chain attack hit 600,000+ companies
🔴 **CircleCI (2023):** Secrets theft affected thousands of customers

**The attack pattern:**
1. Compromise one vendor with weak security
2. Use vendor's trusted access to customers
3. Lateral movement across entire supply chain
4. Multiply impact by 1000x

**What changes in 2026:**

✅ **Vendor risk assessment becomes continuous**, not annual
✅ **SBOM requirements** for all software procurement
✅ **Zero-trust vendor access** (no persistent credentials)
✅ **Supply chain threat intelligence** monitoring
✅ **Cyber insurance requires vendor security audits**

💡 **Hard truth:** You can have perfect security and still get breached because your email vendor's developer got phished.

Do you know your vendors' security postures? Can you prove it during an audit?

# Supply Chain Security: The Attack Vector You Can't Fully Control

## The SolarWinds Lesson We Keep Forgetting

December 2020. Security firm FireEye announced they'd been breached. Not by some unknown zero-day, but through a compromised software update from SolarWinds—a company whose Orion platform monitored networks for over 18,000 customers.

The attackers didn't breach 18,000 companies individually. They breached one software vendor and rode that trojan horse into:
- Fortune 500 companies
- U.S. government agencies
- Critical infrastructure operators
- Security companies (the irony!)

This was the supply chain attack that woke everyone up. But it wasn't the first. And it definitely wasn't the last.
