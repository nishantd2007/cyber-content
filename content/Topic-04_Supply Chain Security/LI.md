📦 **Supply Chain Security: The Attack Vector You Can't Fully Control**

Your security team is top-notch. Your infrastructure is locked down. Your employees are trained.

But what about your vendors? And their vendors? And those vendors' vendors? 🤔

**The uncomfortable reality:**
→ Average company has 850+ third-party vendors
→ 63% of breaches involve third-party access
→ 742% increase in supply chain attacks since 2024
→ SBOM (Software Bill of Materials) compliance now mandatory for federal contracts

**Recent wake-up calls:**

🔴 **SolarWinds (2020):** 18,000+ customers compromised via trojanized update
🔴 **Kaseya (2021):** 1,500+ companies hit via MSP software update
🔴 **3CX (2023):** VoIP software supply chain attack hit 600,000+ companies
🔴 **CircleCI (2023):** Secrets theft affected thousands of customers

**The attack pattern:**

1. Compromise one vendor with weak security
2. Use vendor's trusted access to customers
3. Lateral movement across entire supply chain
4. Multiply impact by 1000x

**What changes in 2026:**

✅ **Vendor risk assessment becomes continuous**, not annual
✅ **SBOM requirements** for all software procurement
✅ **Zero-trust vendor access** (no persistent credentials)
✅ **Supply chain threat intelligence** monitoring
✅ **Cyber insurance requires vendor security audits**

💡 **Hard truth:** You can have perfect security and still get breached because your email vendor's developer got phished.

Do you know your vendors' security postures? Can you prove it during an audit?
