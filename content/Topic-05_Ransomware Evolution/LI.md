🔒 **Ransomware 2026: It's Not Just About Encryption Anymore**

Remember when ransomware just encrypted your files and asked for payment? Those were simpler times. 😅

**Welcome to Triple Extortion Ransomware:**

🔴 **Extortion 1:** We encrypted your data (classic)
🔴 **Extortion 2:** We stole it first, we'll leak it if you don't pay
🔴 **Extortion 3:** We'll DDoS your recovery efforts and tell your customers/investors/partners

**The 2026 ransomware landscape:**

→ Average ransom payment: **$2.3 million** (up 89% from 2024)
→ Average downtime: **287 hours** (12+ days)
→ Recovery costs (beyond ransom): **$4.54 million**
→ Attacks with data exfiltration: **89%**

**What's evolved:**

✅ **Ransomware-as-a-Service (RaaS)** - Anyone can launch attacks now
✅ **Professional negotiators** - Gangs have customer service teams
✅ **Data leak sites** - Public pressure to pay
✅ **Supply chain targeting** - Hit one MSP, encrypt hundreds of clients
✅ **Cloud-native ransomware** - Your S3 buckets aren't safe either

**Real incidents:**

• **Colonial Pipeline:** Paid $4.4M, still took weeks to recover
• **JBS (meat processor):** Paid $11M to prevent food supply disruption  
• **Kaseya MSP attack:** 1,500+ downstream victims
• **Costa Rica government:** Entire country declared national emergency

💡 **The brutal truth:** Paying ransom doesn't guarantee recovery. 40% of companies that paid still lost data.

**The prevention stack:**
✅ Immutable backups (offline, tested monthly)
✅ Network segmentation
✅ EDR with ransomware detection
✅ Privileged access management
✅ Incident response plan (tested quarterly)

Are your backups truly immutable? When's the last time you tested recovery?
