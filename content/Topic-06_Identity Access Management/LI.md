## 🔐 **Identity & Access Management: Your New Security Perimeter in 2026**

The network perimeter is gone.

The new perimeter? **Identity.**

---

### 🚨 The Crisis:

→ 81% of breaches involve compromised credentials  
→ Average employee has **191 passwords**  
→ 51% of employees reuse passwords across work and personal accounts  
→ MFA bypass attacks up **200% year-over-year**

---

### ❌ What's Broken:

✗ Static passwords (easily stolen, phished, or brute-forced)  
✗ SMS-based MFA (vulnerable to SIM swapping)  
✗ Overly broad permissions (users have more access than needed)  
✗ Stale accounts (former employees still have access)  
✗ Shared credentials (impossible to audit or revoke)

---

### ✅ What's Working in 2026:

■ Passwordless authentication (FIDO2, biometrics, hardware keys)  
■ Phishing-resistant MFA (not SMS!)  
■ Just-in-time access provisioning  
■ Continuous authentication and risk-based access  
■ Regular access reviews and recertification

### 🔄 The Shift

IAM isn't IT's problem anymore — it's the business's problem.

Every access decision is a security decision.

When did you last review who has access to what in your organization?
