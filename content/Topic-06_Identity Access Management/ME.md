# Identity & Access Management: The New Security Perimeter

## The Password Problem That Won't Die

Despite decades of warnings, passwords remain the weakest link in cybersecurity.

- 81% of data breaches involve compromised credentials.
- The average employee manages 191 passwords.
- 51% reuse the same password across work and personal accounts.

Welcome to the identity crisis of 2026.

## Why Traditional IAM Is Failing

### Password Overload

Too many passwords to remember. Users choose weak, reusable passwords. Password managers help — but aren't universally adopted.

### Phishing

Even strong passwords fail against phishing. Traditional MFA (SMS, email codes) can be bypassed.

### Privilege Creep

Users accumulate permissions over time. No one reviews or revokes unnecessary access. Former employees retain access for weeks or months.

## The Modern IAM Stack

### 🔐 Passwordless Authentication

- FIDO2 hardware security keys
- Biometric authentication (face, fingerprint)
- Certificate-based authentication
- Passkeys synced across devices

---

### 🛡️ Phishing-Resistant MFA

- Hardware tokens (YubiKey, Titan)
- Biometrics
- Push notifications with number matching
- NOT SMS or email codes

---

### ⏳ Just-in-Time Access

- Provision access only when needed
- Automatic revocation after a defined time period
- Approval workflows for sensitive access

---

### 📊 Continuous Authentication

- Risk-based access decisions
- Behavioral biometrics (typing patterns, mouse movements)
- Session monitoring and re-authentication

---

## The Bottom Line

In 2026, identity IS the perimeter.

Every access decision matters.

Passwordless isn't optional anymore — it's survival.
