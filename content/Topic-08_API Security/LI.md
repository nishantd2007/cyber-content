🔌 **API Security: The Attack Surface You Forgot to Secure**

APIs power everything in 2026. Your mobile app, your integrations, your automation, your microservices.

And **94% of organizations had an API security incident in 2025**. 🚨

**The API explosion:**

→ **83% of all web traffic** is now API calls (up from 64% in 2023)
→ Average organization has **15,000+ APIs** (and that's just the ones they know about)
→ **Shadow APIs:** 42% of APIs are undocumented/unknown
→ **API vulnerabilities:** OWASP API Security Top 10 constantly exploited

**Why APIs are targeted:**

✅ **Direct data access** - No UI obscurity, straight to the database
✅ **Authentication weaknesses** - Broken object-level authorization
✅ **Rate limiting failures** - No throttling = easy scraping/brute forcing
✅ **Excessive data exposure** - Returning entire objects when only partial needed
✅ **Lack of visibility** - Security teams don't know APIs exist

**Real breaches:**

• **Optus (Australia):** 10M customer records via unauthenticated API endpoint
• **Peloton:** User data exposed via BOLA (Broken Object Level Authorization)
• **T-Mobile:** Multiple API-based breaches exposing millions
• **Facebook:** 533M users' data scraped via unprotected API

**What's changing in 2026:**

✅ **API discovery and inventory** tools becoming mandatory
✅ **Runtime API protection** (RASP for APIs)
✅ **API security testing** in CI/CD pipelines
✅ **GraphQL security** emerging as critical focus
✅ **API threat intelligence** integration

💡 **Reality check:** You probably have APIs you don't know about, exposed to the internet right now, with zero security controls.

**Quick test:**

- Do you have a complete API inventory? (Most don't)
- Are all APIs authenticated? (Many aren't)
- Do you rate limit API calls? (Often forgotten)
- Are you testing API security before production? (Rarely)

If you answered "no" to any of these, you have an API security problem.
