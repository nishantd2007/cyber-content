🌐 **Browser-Based Attacks: The Security Blindspot Everyone Ignores**

Here's what changed: **75% of enterprise data is now accessed via browsers**.

And how many companies have browser security? **5%**. 🤦‍♂️

**The browser is the new endpoint. And it's completely unprotected.**

**Why browsers are targeted:**

→ **Direct access to data** - SaaS apps, cloud platforms, productivity tools
→ **Trusted by users** - "It's just a website, it's safe"
→ **Endpoint security blind spot** - Can't see inside browser
→ **Extensions = malware delivery** - 500M Chrome extension users
→ **Session tokens in cookies** - Steal cookie, bypass authentication

**Attack vectors:**

🔴 **Malicious browser extensions** - 87% include trackers/malware
🔴 **In-browser phishing** - Fake login pages in iframe, perfect pixel-for-pixel clones
🔴 **Session hijacking** - Cookie theft via XSS, info-stealers
🔴 **Clipboard jacking** - Modify copied wallet addresses, credentials
🔴 **Web skimming** (Magecart) - Steal payment info at checkout

**Real attacks:**

• **Cyber Partisans** malware extension - 28M+ installations before removal
• **VPN extensions** selling browsing data to third parties
• **Magecart attacks** on 10,000+ e-commerce sites monthly
• **Session token theft** bypassing MFA via cookie stealing

**What's changing in 2026:**

✅ **Browser isolation** (remote browser, local display)
✅ **Browser security platforms** (Talon, Island, LayerX)
✅ **Extension allow-listing** (only approved extensions)
✅ **Anti-phishing AI** detecting pixel-perfect clones
✅ **Cookie protection** from theft

💡 **Uncomfortable truth:** Your users are logging into SaaS apps with zero browser security controls. Every tab is a potential breach.

**Quick check:**

- Do you control which browser extensions users install? (Most don't)
- Can you detect in-browser phishing? (Endpoint tools can't)
- Do you protect session cookies from theft? (Usually not)
- Can you see what data is accessed in browsers? (Typically no)

The browser is your largest attack surface. And the least protected.
